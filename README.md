# Shop-Editor
A GUI tool for editing shops in Persona 5 Royal.

This is a tool for editing all of the regular shops in P5R (not including takemi or Iwai).

[.Net 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) is required to run this program.

To use, run the .exe. On the top left, click on file -> open, and open your EN/INIT/FCLTABLE.BIN. You should now be able to edit shops to your hearts content. To save, click on file -> save, and save wherever you want, just be sure not to overwrite your vanilla copy.

Here's a table of the shop banners and they're associated ID's: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_mY7O-v_n713clnKh2eZG-gwADmpx4Er1oWvK0LUWqM/edit#gid=0

# Shop-Editor
A GUI tool for editing shops in Persona 5 (Royal).

This is a tool for editing all of the regular shops in P5/P5R (not including takemi or Iwai).

[.Net 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) is required to run this program.

I apologize for the short and lackluster readme, though I believe that usage of this program is pretty self explanatory outside of what I go over below.
## First Setup
To use, run the .exe once to create the necessary folders to put your shop ftds in. Once that's done, grab fclPublicShopItemTable.ftd and fclPublicShopName.ftd from data/init/facility.pak/fclTable.bin in your game's files, and drag them into ```Original/(gameversion)```.

the program should now open, and you'll be able to edit the shops as you want. Changes made will automatically be saved to a temp file, so you don't need to worry about losing progress when switching shops or even closing the program.

## Saving
When you're done editing stuff, click "Save" in order to save the ftd to the output folder. If the amount of items in each shop is the same as in the original file, the program will also generate a Binary patch file (.bp) which you should use *instead* of the output ftd. "Shop_Items.bp" should be used instead of "fclPublicShopItemTable.ftd", and "Shop_Names.bp" should be used instead of "fclPublicShopName.ftd".

You can also edit the names of the shop, which for some shops show a white textbox in game. A .bp file will always be generated for shop name edits.

## Using in a Mod
### Binary Patch Output
All .bp files in your output folders should be put in either a new or existing Aemulus mod, inside a folder called "binarypatches" in the root of the mod folder. Base files will need to be unpacked in order for binary patches to be used.

### Ftd Output
ftd output files should only be used if a corresponding .bp file has not been generated. In the root of your aemulus mod folder, create the following directory: ```init/facility/fclTable/```.
